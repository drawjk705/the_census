## Getting started

### View all datasets

If you you're not sure what Census dataset you're interested in, the following code will take care of you:

```python
from the_census import Census

Census.list_available_datasets()
```

This will present you with a pandas DataFrame listing all available datasets from the US Census API. (This includes only aggregate datasets, as they other types [of which there are very few] don't play nice with the client).

### Help with terminology

Some of the terms used in the data returned can be a bit opaque. To get a clearer sense of what some of those mean, run this:

```python
Census.help()
```

This will print out links to documentation for various datasets, along with what their group/variable names mean, and how statistics were calculated.

### Selecting a dataset

Before getting started, you need to [get a Census API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html), and set the following the environment variable `CENSUS_API_KEY` to whatever that key is, either with

```bash
export CENSUS_API_KEY=<your key>
```

or in a `.env` file:

```bash
CENSUS_API_KEY=<your key>
```

Say you're interested in the American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2019. Look up the dataset and survey name in the table provided by `list_available_datasets`, and execute the following code:

```python
>>> from the_census import Census
>>> Census(year=2019, dataset="acs", survey="acs1")

<Census year=2019 dataset=acs survey=acs1>
```

The `dataset` object will now let you query any census data for the the ACS 1-year estimates of 2019. We'll now dive into how to query this dataset with the tool. However, if you aren't familiar with dataset "architecture", check out [this](#dataset-architecture) section.

### Arguments to `Census`

This is the signature of `Census`:

```python
class Census
    def __init__(self,
                 year: int,
                 dataset: str = "acs",
                 survey: str = "acs1",
                 cache_dir: str = CACHE_DIR,        # cache
                 should_load_from_existing_cache: bool = False,
                 should_cache_on_disk: bool = False,
                 replace_column_headers: bool = True,
                 log_file: str = DEFAULT_LOG_FILE): # census.log
        pass
```

-   `year`: the year of the dataset
-   `dataset`: type of the dataset, specified by [`list_available_datasets`](#view-all-datasets)
-   `survey`: type of the survey, specified by [`list_available_datasets`](#view-all-datasets)
-   `cache_dir`: if you opt in to on-disk caching (more on this below), the name of the directory in which to store cached data
-   `should_load_from_existing_cache`: if you have cached data from a previous session, this will reload cached data into the `Census` object, instead of hitting the Census API when that data is queried
-   `should_cache_on_disk`: whether or not to cache data on disk, to avoid repeat API calls. The following data will be cached:
    -   Supported Geographies
    -   Group codes
    -   Variable codes
-   `replace_column_headers`: whether or not to replace column header names for variables with more intelligible names instead of their codes
-   `log_file`: name of the file in which to store logging information

#### A note on caching

While on-disk caching is optional, this tool, by design, performs in-memory caching. So a call to `census.get_groups()` will hit the Census API one time at most. All subsequent calls will retrieve the value cached in-memory.

## Making queries

### Supported geographies

Getting the [supported geographies](#supported-geographies) for a dataset as as simple as this:

```python
census.get_supported_geographies()
```

This will output a DataFrame will all possible supported geographies (e.g., if I can query all school districts across all states).

#### Supported geographies autocomplete

If you don't want to have to keep on typing supported geographies after this, you can use tab-completion in Jupyter by typing:

```python
census.supported_geographies.<TAB>
```

### Geography codes

If you decide you want to query a particular geography (e.g., a particular school district within a particular state), you'll need the [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code#FIPS_state_codes) codes for that school district and state.

So, if you're interested in all school districts in Colorado, here's what you'd do:

1. Get FIPS codes for all states:

```python
from the_census import GeoDomain

census.get_geography_codes(GeoDomain("state", "*"))
```

Or, if you don't want to import `GeoDomain`, and prefer to use tuples:

```python
census.get_geography_codes(("state", "*"))
```

2. Get FIPS codes for all school districts within Colorado (FIPS code `08`):

```python
census.get_geography_codes(GeoDomain("school district", "*"),
                           GeoDomain("state", "08"))
```

Or, if you don't want to import `GeoDomain`, and prefer to use tuples:

```python
census.get_geography_codes(("school district", "*"),
                           ("state", "08"))
```

Note that geography code queries must follow supported geography guidelines.

### Groups

Want to figure out what groups are available for your dataset? No problem. This will do the trick for ya:

```python
census.get_groups()
```

...and you'll get a DataFrame with all groups for your census.

#### Searching groups

`census.get_groups()` will return a lot of data that might be difficult to slog through. In that case, run this:

```python
census.search_groups(regex=r"my regex")
```

and you'll get a filtered DataFrame with matches to your regex.

#### Groups autocomplete

If you're working in a Jupyter notebook and have autocomplete enabled, running `census.groups.`, followed by a tab, will trigger an autocomplete menu for possible groups by their name (as opposed to their code, which doesn't have any inherent meaning in and of itself).

```python
census.groups.SexByAge   # code for this group
```

### Variables

You can either get a DataFrame of variables based on a set of groups:

```python
census.get_variables_by_group(census.groups.SexByAge,
                              census.groups.MedianAgeBySex)
```

Or, you can get a DataFrame with all variables for a given dataset:

```python
census.get_all_variables()
```

This second operation, can, however, take a lot of time.

#### Searching variables

Similar to groups, you can search variables by regex:

```python
census.search_variables(r"my regex")
```

And, you can limit that search to variables of a particular group or groups:

```python
census.search_variables(r"my regex", census.groups.SexByAge)
```

#### Variables autocomplete

Variables also support autocomplete for their codes, as with groups.

```python
census.variables.EstimateTotal_B01001  # code for this variable
```

(These names must be suffixed with the group code, since, while variable codes are unique across groups, their names are not unique across groups.)

### Statistics

Once you have the variables you want to query, along with the geography you're interested in, you can now make statistics queries from your dataset:

```python
from the_census import GeoDomain

variables = census.get_variables_for_group(census.groups.SexByAge)

census.get_stats(variables["code"].tolist(),
                 GeoDomain("school district", "*"),
                 GeoDomain("state", "08"))
```

Or, if you'd rather use tuples instead of `GeoDomain`:

```python
variables = census.get_variables_for_group(census.groups.SexByAge)

census.get_stats(variables["code"].tolist(),
                 ("school district", "*"),
                 ("state", "08"))
```

## General notes on autocomplete

Jupyter notebook/lab has been having an issue with autocomplete lately (see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2435)), so running the following in your environment should help you take advantage of the autocomplete offerings of this package:

```
pip install jedi==0.17.2
```

## Dataset "architecture"

US Census datasets have 3 primary components:

1.  [Groups](#groups)
2.  [Variables](#variables)
3.  [Supported Geographies](#supported-geographies)

### Groups

A group is a "category" of data gathered for a particular census. For example, the `SEX BY AGE` group would provide breakdowns of gender and age demographics in a given region in the United States.

Some of these groups' names, however, are a not as clear as `SEX BY AGE`. In that case, I recommend heading over to the survey in question's [technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/) which elaborates on what certain terms mean with respect to particular groups. Unfortunately, the above link might be complicated to navigate, but if you're looking for ACS group documentation, [here's](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2019_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf) a handy link.

(You can also get these links by running `Census.help()`.)

### Variables

Variables measure a particular data-point. While they have their own codes, you might find variables which share the same name (e.g., `Estimate!!:Total:`). This is because each variable belongs to a [group](#group). So, the `Estimate!!:Total` variable for `SEX BY AGE` group is the total of all queried individuals in that group; but the `Estimate!!:Total` variable for `POVERTY STATUS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS BY AGE` group is the total of queried individuals for _that_ group. (It's important when calculating percentages that you work within the same group. So if I want the percent of men in the US, whose total number I got from `SEX BY AGE` I should use the `Estimate!!:Total:` of that group as my denominator, and not the `Estimate!!:Total:` of the `POVERTY STATUS` group).

Variables on their own, however, do nothing. They mean something only when you query a particular [geography](#supported-geographies) for them.

### Supported Geographies

Supported geographies dictate the kinds of queries you can make for a given census. For example, in the ACS-1, I might be interested in looking at stats across all school districts. The survey's supported geographies will tell me if I can actually do that; or, if I need to refine my query to look at school districts in a given state or smaller region.
